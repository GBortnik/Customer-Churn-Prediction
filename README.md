# Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning techniques. Based on the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, several classification models were tested â€” including ***Logistic Regression***, ***Random Forest***, and ***XGBoost***. Logistic Regression was selected as the final model due to its superior performance on evaluation metrics.

The entire project was developed in the ***Azure Machine Learning*** environment using Jupyter notebooks, allowing for efficient experimentation and model tracking.

To make the solution interactive and user-friendly, a ***Streamlit*** web application was developed. The demo allows users to input customer data and receive churn predictions along with the probability score. The application also includes a debug mode and a feature impact view, offering additional insights into model behavior.
