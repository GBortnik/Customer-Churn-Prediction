# Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning techniques. Based on the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, several classification models were tested â€” including ***Logistic Regression***, ***Random Forest***, and ***XGBoost***. Logistic Regression was selected as the final model due to its superior performance on evaluation metrics.

The entire project was developed in the ***Azure Machine Learning*** environment using Jupyter notebooks, allowing for efficient experimentation and model tracking.

To make the solution interactive and user-friendly, a ***Streamlit*** web application was developed. The demo allows users to input customer data and receive churn predictions along with the probability score. The application also includes a debug mode and a feature impact view, offering additional insights into model behavior.

## Demo
A live demo of the churn prediction app is available [HERE](https://gbchurnprediction.streamlit.app/).

The app is built with Streamlit and allows users to:

- Input customer data and receive a churn prediction.
- View the churn probability as a percentage.
- Enable Debug Mode to inspect how features are transformed before prediction.
- Enable Feature Impact to view model coefficients and the relative influence of each feature.

Below are some screenshots from the application:
